# Standard Workflow

1. Start every feature with A/LEAD.
2. Never jump directly to implementation.
3. Always hand off explicitly between agents.
4. Treat tasks.md as the single source of truth for execution.
5. Prefer simple, reversible solutions.
6. Optimize for clarity before performance.

## GitHub-first Execution (Mandatory)

7. One task = one branch = one Pull Request.
8. Never commit directly to `main`.
9. Create and push a feature branch **before** implementation.
10. Request C/REVIEW only through a Pull Request.
11. A task is considered **done only after the PR is merged into `main`**.
12. Always start the next task from an updated `main` branch.
